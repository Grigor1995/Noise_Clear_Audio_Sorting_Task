# Task_From_Krisp
I wrote a script that play the imagine audio files one by one, after play each file it wait for user input - ‘n/N/noise/Noise’ (for noisy) or ‘c/C/clear/Clear’ (for clean).After pressing the corresponding key, the transition to the next file takes place. After all the files are processed, the export of the json file begins, which contains the file names and corresponding labels.
